A game of yahtzee for CPTS 121 programming assignment 5. Completed on 10/27/2020.

This game of yahtzee is for two players. There is an option to display rules at the beginning of the game, play the game, or exit. The game rolls dice, lets players choose which dice to reroll, and lets them choose where to enter the roll on their scorecards. After the game a bonus is added if a player has met the point requirements. A winner is decided at the end.

# Three Files Are Required:

yahtzee.h: contains declarations for functions defined in yahtzee.c.

yahtzee.c: contains definitions for functions declared in yahtzee.h.

main.c: contains the main function for the game played on the terminal.

# Possible Improvements

This game could be improved by storing the players score cards in a file so the game can be resumed later.

The game could also be improved by allowing players to enter their names to be used instead of "player 1" and "player 2".
